# Multiuser Chat Application  in Java

This is a multiuser chatting application developed in Java, utilizing various concepts such as GUI programming, socket programming, JDBC, MySQL, multithreading, and design patterns. The application allows multiple users to connect and communicate with each other in real-time.

User Registration and Login:

Users can create new accounts with unique usernames and passwords.
Existing users can log in using their credentials.
The application should perform authentication to verify user identity.
Chat Rooms:

Users can join different chat rooms based on their interests or preferences.
Each chat room serves as a separate communication channel where users can exchange messages.
Real-Time Messaging:

Once a user joins a chat room, they can send and receive messages in real-time.
The application should handle message delivery efficiently to ensure seamless communication.
Message Broadcasting:

Messages sent by any user in a chat room should be broadcasted to all users in that room.
This ensures that everyone connected to a particular chat room can view and participate in the conversation.
Persistent Data Storage:

User information, such as usernames and passwords, should be stored in a database using JDBC.
This allows for secure storage and easy retrieval of user data.
Java Swing GUI:

The application's graphical user interface is built using Java Swing.
It should be user-friendly and intuitive for a smooth chatting experience.
Socket Programming:

TCP/IP sockets are used for network communication between the client and server.
Sockets enable data exchange between users and the server in real-time.
Multithreading:

To handle multiple client connections simultaneously, the application utilizes multithreading.
This ensures that the server can serve multiple clients concurrently without blocking operations.
Window Builder:

Window Builder - a GUI designer tool for Java applications, simplifies the creation of the user interface.
It allows developers to design the GUI visually, saving time and effort.
Design Patterns:

Design patterns like Singleton, Observer, and Factory may be used to enhance code structure and maintainability.
Singleton may be used to ensure only one instance of critical components like the database connection is created.
Observer pattern can help in updating the user interface when new messages arrive or users join/leave chat rooms.
Factory pattern may assist in creating chat rooms or other objects in a centralized and organized manner.
